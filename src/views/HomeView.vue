      <h1>FW 1.0 (Early Access)</h1>
      <p>
        This is the glitchy, DEFCON 32 early access version, meaning the base functionality works,
        but there is a lot of polishing and features being worked on still. I want to thank you for
        your support. If you have any comments, bugs, or would like to contribute a pull request,
        please check out
        <a href="https://miswired.io/glitchy" target="blank">miswired.io/glitchy</a> and the
        <a href="https://github.com/miswired/glitchy" target="blank">github repo</a>. You may also
        want to download and flash the latest version of the software.
